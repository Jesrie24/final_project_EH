# Ethical Hacking Technical Report

### Client: CyberTech Solutions Inc.
### Date: May 10, 2024
### Prepared by: Jesrie Cena and Vic Johnry Campon

### Executive Summary
This report summarizes the results of a vulnerability assessment done on CyberTech Solutions Inc.'s systems and infrastructure. The evaluation tried to identify and prioritize any security vulnerabilities that might harm the organization's assets and operations.

### Vulnerability Summary:

#### 1. Unpatched Software: 
  - High: Several systems were found running outdated software versions, including operating systems and applications, leaving them susceptible to known vulnerabilities.
   
#### 2. Weak Password Policies:
 -  High: Many user accounts were discovered with weak passwords, such as default or easily guessable passwords, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.

#### 3. Missing Security Patches:
 -  High: Critical security patches for operating systems and software were not applied promptly, exposing systems to exploitation by known vulnerabilities.

#### 4. Open Ports and Services:
  - High: Unused ports and services were found open on various systems, potentially providing entry points for attackers to gain unauthorized access.

#### 5. Lack of Network Segmentation:
  - High: The network infrastructure lacks proper segmentation, allowing attackers to move laterally across the network once inside.

#### 6. Insecure Network Protocols:
  - High: Some network protocols, such as Telnet and FTP, were observed being used without encryption, posing risks of data interception and unauthorized access.

#### 7. Insufficient Logging and Monitoring:
  - High: Logging and monitoring mechanisms were found to be inadequate, hindering the detection of suspicious activities and security incidents.

#### 8. Missing Web Application Security:
  - High: Web applications were found to be vulnerable to common attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure direct object references (IDOR).

#### 9. Weak Physical Security:
  - High: Physical access controls were found to be lacking, potentially allowing unauthorized individuals to gain physical access to sensitive areas and equipment.

#### 10. Outdated SSL/TLS Configurations:
  - High: SSL/TLS configurations were found to be outdated, leaving communication channels vulnerable to attacks such as POODLE and BEAST.

### Recommendations:

#### 1. Implement Regular Patch Management:
- Establish a proactive patch management process to ensure timely application of security patches for all systems and software.

#### 2. Enforce Strong Password Policies:
- Enforce password complexity requirements and implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to strengthen user authentication mechanisms.

#### 3. Close Unused Ports and Services:
- Conduct a thorough review of open ports and services and close those that are not necessary for business operations.

#### 4. Implement Network Segmentation:
- Segment the network into separate zones based on security requirements and implement access controls to restrict lateral movement of attackers.

#### 5. Secure Network Protocols:
- Replace insecure protocols with secure alternatives such as SSH for remote access and HTTPS for web communication.

#### 6. Enhance Logging and Monitoring:
- Implement robust logging and monitoring solutions to track and analyze system activities, enabling timely detection and response to security incidents.

#### 7. Perform Web Application Security Testing:
- Conduct regular security assessments, including penetration testing and code reviews, to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in web applications.

#### 8. Improve Physical Security Measures:
- Enhance physical access controls, such as access badges and surveillance cameras, to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive areas.

#### 9. Update SSL/TLS Configurations:
- Update SSL/TLS configurations to use the latest cryptographic standards and protocols, and disable support for insecure protocols and cipher suites.

### Conclusion:

Addressing discovered vulnerabilities and implementing recommended assistance. procedures is critical to improving CyberTech Solutions Inc's overall security posture. By fixing vulnerabilities, the company may reduce the risk of cyber attacks while also protecting its assets and reputation.
